# Exploratory Data Aanlysis (EDA) on retail data with python
# INTRODUCTION
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to understand the structure, quality, and underlying patterns of the Online Retail dataset. The study focuses on identifying trends in sales behavior, customer distribution, and potential data anomalies. Through descriptive statistics and visual exploration, this phase provides essential insights that guide subsequent modeling and business interpretation.

# STEPS :

1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.
2. Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any redundant or unnecessary columns.
3. Explore the basic statistics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.
4. Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.
5. Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
6. Explore the top-selling products and countries based on the quantity sold.
7. Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.
8. Draw conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.

# CONCLUSION :
The exploratory analysis of the Online Retail dataset provided a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamics of sales recorded by a British e-commerce company between 2010 and 2011. After performing data cleaning to remove missing values and obvious anomalies (such as unit prices equal to zero, negative quantities, or missing customer identifiers), the initial observations revealed that the majority of transactions originated from the United Kingdom, while other countries represented only a marginal share of total revenue.

The analysis of quantitative variables, particularly quantity and unit price, highlighted the presence of outliers mainly corresponding to bulk orders or exceptionally expensive products. These outliers can influence the mean and distort certain descriptive statistics, underscoring the need to use more robust measures such as the median or the interquartile range.

From a temporal perspective, the monthly distribution of revenue shows a clear seasonal pattern, with a noticeable peak in activity during the months preceding Christmas, reflecting the importance of seasonal sales in the companyâ€™s performance. In conclusion, after appropriate cleaning, this dataset serves as a reliable foundation for more advanced analyses, including customer segmentation and predictive modeling of purchasing behavior. This exploratory phase thus emphasizes the importance of preprocessing and developing a thorough understanding of the data before applying statistical or machine learning methods.
